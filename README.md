TechnologyUG Presentation - April 2019

The URLs and attached documents were presented at the Technology User Group (TechUG - https://techug.org.uk/) conference in Leeds on 25th April 2019. I have included them here for reference and ease of access.

This information is also available on my blog - https://www.bytesizedalex.com/techug-april-2019/

It should be noted that the slides are used as talking points and do not encompass the full discussion.

While I am happy for people to reference the material I would be grateful if any copies reference this repository or my blog.
